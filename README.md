#### User Stories: Implement Vanilla JS Google Maps. Make it so Users can Message One Another, and It will send an Email to Other User. Change it so Reviews are of Users, and Make Votes be Commendations or Defamations on Users. Change Review so it is like would you rather comment. Maybe add a comment type feed in the app. Make it so all the above listed items are automatically assigned to the current user. Add a contact us modal pop up that will send an email. Make ratings a commendation aspect, each user gets three commendations max with one added each day. Add pagination ot lists through ajax. Add trade locations through Portland with ability to be routed to nearest station. Add table that shows all of the nearest users to a particular user and ability to see those users products. Give ability to have multiple pictures per product. Make it so users can see other users bio pages and their distance from your location if you are logged in. Have authentication based through facebook. Make it so user location is only an estimate of their address. Make editing for products possible only if that product belongs to the current user.
